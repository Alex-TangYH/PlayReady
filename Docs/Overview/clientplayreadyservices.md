# Client Owner Services


Final Product Licensees may design their device or application so as to contact a service when they perform PlayReady operations. A very common scenario is the remote provisioning service, which delivers a unique device certificate to a client the first time it performs a PlayReady operation.

These services are specific to the client owner, and use ad-hoc protocols.

Microsoft operates some of these services for the clients that it develops, for example Windows 10 PlayReady, Windows 8.1 PlayReady, Xbox PlayReady, Silverlight, and so on.
