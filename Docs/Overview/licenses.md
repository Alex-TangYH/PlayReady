# Licenses

After a client retrieves a protected file, that client needs to acquire a license before it can perform actions that use that content. Licenses encapsulate information describing the policies associated with particular content, along with information that is required to decrypt the content. In other words, a license is the key for unlocking content as well as the rules for how that content may be used. Different licenses for the same piece of content may grant different rights or right restrictions for that content.

Licenses are acquired either directly from license servers or through a proxy server.

The following topics describe the different ways in which licenses can be used by PlayReady to play back content.
